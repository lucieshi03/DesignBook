# Chapter 2 Practice Exercises

## Exercise 1

Why is it technically possible to represent a playing card using six Boolean values (as mentioned on page 15)? Rewrite class [`Card`](../chapter-code-2ndEdition/e2/chapter2/Card.java) so that it is internally represented as six Boolean values. What is the impact of this change of the maintainers of class `Card`? What is the impact of this change on the users of class `Card`?

public class Card {
Bool 


## Exercise 2

Re-implement class `Card` as a single enumerated type. For the purpose of the Solitaire application, does this look like a superior or inferior solution to [this version](../chapter-code-2ndEdition/e2/chapter2/Card.java)? Why? Try writing down your answer in specific terms using terminology seen in Chapter 2.

## Exercise 3

Modify the [`Suit`](../chapter-code-2ndEdition/e2/chapter2/Suit.java) enumerated type to include a method `color()` that returns the color of the suit. The return type should be a new enumerated type `Color`.

## Exercise 4

Modify class [`Card`](../chapter-code-2ndEdition/e2/chapter2/Card.java) to support the concept of a "Joker" (a special card that is not in any suit) while keeping the class as encapsulated as possible.

## Exercise 5 

Further modify your class to support any number of distinct jokers. For example, a "high" joker vs. a "low" joker, or even three jokers, etc. Again, try to keep things encapsulated and respectful of the class design guidelines seen in the chapter.

## Problem 6 

Find a different way to implement method `getCards()` to the [`Deck`](../chapter-code-2ndEdition/e2/chapter2/Deck.java) class to return the cards in the deck without breaking encapsulation.

## Exercise 7

Create a new class called `MultiDeck` that contains a list of decks (some card games require multiple decks). Make the class copyable through a copy constructor. First, make a shallow copy of the decks contained. Use the debugger to confirm that the decks in a multi-deck are shared between an original multi-deck and its copies. Then, use deep copying to make copied multi-decks fully distinct object graphs. Use design by contract and the `assert` statement to clarify the class's interface.

## Exercise 8

Create a UML Object Diagram of a `MultiDeck` instance.

## Exercise 9 :mag:

Study JetUML's [MultiLineString](https://github.com/prmr/JetUML/blob/v1.0/src/ca/mcgill/cs/stg/jetuml/framework/MultiLineString.java) class and assess the quality of its encapsulation. Is it possible to modify its state without going through its methods?
